# COURSE CORRECTION (2025-12-18):
# ================================
# Decision: Migrate from GCP Cloud Run + E2B to Full Vercel Stack
# Reason: E2B implementation was a workaround; Vercel Sandbox has first-party Claude SDK support
# See: sprint-change-proposal-vercel-migration-2025-12-18.md
#
# Key Changes:
#   - Story 3-0: Retargeted from E2B to Vercel Sandbox
#   - Story 1-6: Deprecated (Cloud Run no longer used)
#   - Story 1-7: Needs rework for Vercel deployment
#   - All E2B/GCP infrastructure to be removed

# STATUS DEFINITIONS:
# ==================
# Epic Status:
#   - backlog: Epic not yet started
#   - in-progress: Epic actively being worked on
#   - done: All stories in epic completed
#
# Epic Status Transitions:
#   - backlog → in-progress: Automatically when first story is created (via create-story)
#   - in-progress → done: Manually when all stories reach 'done' status
#
# Story Status:
#   - backlog: Story only exists in epic file
#   - ready-for-dev: Story file created in stories folder
#   - in-progress: Developer actively working on implementation
#   - review: Ready for code review (via Dev's code-review workflow)
#   - done: Story completed
#
# Retrospective Status:
#   - optional: Can be completed but not required
#   - done: Retrospective has been completed
#
# WORKFLOW NOTES:
# ===============
# - Epic transitions to 'in-progress' automatically when first story is created
# - Stories can be worked in parallel if team capacity allows
# - SM typically creates next story after previous one is 'done' to incorporate learnings
# - Dev moves story to 'review', then runs code-review (fresh context, different LLM recommended)
